# tales-of-xadia-foundry-vtt-cortex-theme

A fan made module for Foundry VTT and the Cortex Prime game system that styles the character sheet to more closely resemble the official website.

## Installation:

Copy the manifest link into Foundry's module installation dialog:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naresea/tales-of-xadia-foundry-vtt-cortex-theme/main/releases/module.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naresea/tales-of-xadia-foundry-vtt-cortex-theme/main/releases/module.json)

## Background Art:

The default background image was created by [Dream AI](https://dream.ai/) and cropped in GIMP.

## Known Issues:

- You have to either reload after installing the module the first time or toggle to another theme and back in the Cortex Theme Settings before the updated values are displayed
- You probably want to set another sheet background image than the default AI generated one (e.g. one that features actual "The Dragon Prince" art
- Chat-Portraits works best when using quadratic images
- If you're comfortable filling out the character sheet you migth want to remove some of the description text to make it less cluttered
